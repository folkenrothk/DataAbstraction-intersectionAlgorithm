# Intersection Algorithms
  _Completed Fall 2021_

## Project Instructions

- Use the `cd` command to change into the directory for this repository
- Change into the program directory by typing `cd intersection`
- Install the dependencies for the project by typing `poetry install`
- Run the program in with both algorithms by typing:
  - `poetry run intersection --number 1000 --maximum 25 --profile --approach TupleSingle`
  - `poetry run intersection --number 1000 --maximum 25 --profile --approach TupleDouble`
  - `poetry run intersection --number 1000 --maximum 25 --profile --approach ListSingle`
  - `poetry run intersection --number 1000 --maximum 25 --profile --approach ListDouble`
  - Please note that these are not the only configurations you should try for your experiment
  - Please note that the program will not work unless you add the required source code
  - Please refer to the `writing/reflection.md` file for all ways to run the program
- Confirm that the program is producing the expected output

# Findings

Please refer to [the final report](./writing/reflection.md) for experiment design and reflection.
